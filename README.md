# Leah’s Portfolio 

## ABOUT ME
Hello! I'm glad you're here. I am a dedicated software developer and data analyst based in Washington. I am excited to share my projects through this portfolio. 

With a background in Biology, I returned to university to develop strong programming skills. My interest in software development is driven by my desire to tackle challenging problems in healthcare, science, and AI research. 

Beyond coding, I find balance and inspiration in gardening, 3D printing, and birdwatching. I'm enthusiastic about connecting with potential employers and collaborators who share my passions.
