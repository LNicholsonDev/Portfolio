# Leah’s Portfolio 

## ABOUT ME
Hi there! I'm a dedicated software developer and data analyst based in Washington state. I'm excited to share my projects through this portfolio. 

With a background in biological science, research, and healthcare, I developed strong programming skills through a programming and data analysis certification this year (2025). My passion for data science is driven by a desire to tackle challenging problems in these areas. 

Below you will find a collection of my work - Python projects, statistical analyses, AI projects, SQL, database development, and other fun stuff.

I am always happy to connect with potential employers and collaborators who share my passions. Please feel welcome to message me with any comments or questions. Thanks for visiting!
