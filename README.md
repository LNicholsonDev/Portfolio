# Leah’s Portfolio 

## ABOUT ME
Welcome to my repository! I'm a software developer and data analyst based in Washington state. I'm excited to share my projects with you through this portfolio. 

I developed strong programming skills through independent study and a programming certification this year (2025). My passion for data science is driven by a desire to tackle challenging problems in business and science. 

Below you will find a collection of my work - Python projects, ML models, statistical analyses, SQL, database development, and other fun stuff.

I am happy to connect with potential employers and collaborators who share my passions. Please feel welcome to message me with comments or questions. 

Thanks for visiting!
