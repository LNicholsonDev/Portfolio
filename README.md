# Leah’s Portfolio 

## ABOUT ME
Welcome to my repository! I'm a data analyst and developer based in Washington state. I'm excited to share my projects with you through this portfolio. 

I developed strong programming skills through independent study and a programming certification this year (2025). My passion for data science is driven by a desire to tackle challenging problems in business, science, and healthcare. 

Below you will find a collection of my work - Machine Learning models, SQL queries, statistical analyses, database development, Python projects, and other fun stuff.

I am happy to connect with potential employers and collaborators who share my passions. Please feel welcome to message me with comments or questions. 

Thanks for visiting!
