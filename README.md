# Leah’s Portfolio 

## ABOUT ME
Hi there! I'm a dedicated software developer and data analyst based in Washington state. I'm excited to share my projects through this portfolio. 

With a background in Biology, I returned to university to develop strong programming skills. My passion for software development is driven by a desire to tackle challenging problems in bioinformatics, healthcare, and AI research. 

Below you will find a collection of work - Python projects, statistical analyses, AI projects, and other fun stuff.

I am enthusiastic about connecting with potential employers and collaborators who share my passions. 

Please feel welcome to message me with any comments or questions. Thanks for visiting!
