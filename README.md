# Leah’s Portfolio 

## About Me 
Hello! I'm glad you're here. I'm Leah, a dedicated software developer and data analyst based in Washington. I am excited to share my projects with this portfolio. 

Having a background in Biology, I returned to university to develop strong skills in programming. My interest in software development is driven by my desire to tackle challenging problems in healthcare, science, and AI research.

Beyond coding, I find balance and inspiration in gardening, 3D printing, and birdwatching. I'm enthusiastic about connecting with potential employers and collaborators who share my passions.
