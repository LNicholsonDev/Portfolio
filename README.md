# Leah’s Portfolio 

## About Me 
Hello! I'm Leah, a dedicated software developer and data analyst based in Washington. With a passion for coding and an eye for detail, I've committed myself to developing innovative and efficient solutions using Python and SQL.
I am relatively new to GitHub but excited to showcase my work in this portfolio of my journey. My interest in software development is driven by a desire to tackle challenging problems in healthcare, science, and AI research.
Beyond coding, I find balance and inspiration in gardening, 3D printing, and birdwatching. I am enthusiastic about connecting with potential employers and collaborators who share my passions.
